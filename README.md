# face-recognition-deep-face
This project implements a real-time face recognition system using DeepFace for face detection and verification, and OpenCV for webcam video streaming and interface rendering. It compares faces detected in live webcam frames against a reference image , drawing bounding boxes and labeling matched or unknown individuals on-screen.
